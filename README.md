# st - simple terminal

st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

This is the one that I did for myself, but certainly I don't like it yet, my terminal needs some more functionality.
It will be added later.

## Patches

- xresources
- alpha

## Notes:

- To properly render color emoji you need to substitute libxft by [libxft-bgra](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libxft-bgra/).
Otherwise st will crash when a color emoji appears and you will curse your life for being such a damn snob using suckless software.
